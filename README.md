<br/>

In 2020, I had my first contact with the programming world through ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20-%20white?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white&color=%233776AB). Since then, I have continued to evolve and enhance my skills, learning new concepts and technologies along the way.

In 2022, I had the opportunity to gain my **first professional experience developing a mobile application using React Native**. Since then, I felt the desire to definitively transition into this field and dedicate myself fully to programming.
